              The boy’s brigade was found by Sir Alexander Williams Smith. He was born in Glasgow,
              Scotland in October 27th, 1854.William A. Smith was an Army Officer before the lord called
              him for his work; he abandoned his military service and became a Sunday school Teacher at Free
              Church mission, Northwood side hall in Glasgow Scotland. It was found during the time parents
              left their children uncared for. Therefore children became wild, undisciplined and were not
              properly thought with the Bible, hence as an enthusiastic Sunday school Teacher, he discovered
              what was going on and applied his military knowledge forming what is called BOYS BRIGADE
              in order to see that children hears the word of God. Though this Boys Brigade organization started with many boys but due to some of the disobedience which many of our companies are
              facing today made some of the boys ran away due to the hard (harsh) training in Brigade. So they
              remained only 31 boys including Sir William A. Smith and these were the people that formed
              Brigade.
